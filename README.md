## Welcome to our GitHub Page !

Youth initiative for creating Independent Open Source Development environments.

#### In Wrench We Trust !  [4 now]

Our page is still a work in progress, we gradually add new content [through GitHub editor](https://github.com/Shyran-Systems/Home/edit/master/README.md) to maintain this website.

New content and updates on our mission are coming soon...


### Also we use Markdown and other stuff here:

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling the writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

This Page will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme selected in [repository settings](https://github.com/Shyran-Systems/Home/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
